    "description": "This course focuses on essential elements of the consultation/examination appointment for enhancing the predictability and success of complete denture fabrication. It breaks down this initial appointment into three phases: preexamination consultation, clinical edentulous examination and postexamination consultation. • In the preexamination consultation phase, the emphasis is on actively listening to the patient. Understanding their previous experiences with dentures, their adaptability to prostheses, and their specific desires and expectations for new dentures is essential. • The clinical examination involves an assessment of the patient’s oral conditions. This helps determine their restorative needs in alignment with their desires and expectations. The dentist evaluates oral health, anatomy and factors that may affect the success of the dentures, such as stability of the temporomandibular joints and potential airway obstructions. • The final phase, the postexamination consultation, includes a discussion of the findings from the consultation and examination. Here, various options and recommendations are presented, tailored to the patient’s individual needs, wants and expectations. Additionally, a comprehensive informed consent process is crucial and should cover all treatment options and their benefits, risks and associated costs to ensure transparency and foster patient compliance.",
    "educationalObjectives": "Conduct a preexamination consultation that establishes open communication and patient rapport, leading to a better understanding of patient wants and expectations.\nProvide a practical clinical edentulous examination, including evaluating the patient’s oral health and identifying anatomic factors influencing denture success to determine the patient’s needs.\nDiscuss the importance of patient-centered care, including: active listening and empathetic communication to create a comfortable environment where patients can express their wants, expectations and concerns; and incorporating information from the findings of the clinical examination to perform appropriate treatment.\nConduct a thorough informed consent process, including a discussion of treatment options, risks, benefits and fees, and the recognition of the patient's right to choose no treatment."

    "releaseDate": "8/1/2021",
    "description": "In a world of increasing life spans and an ever-growing popularity of dental implants, dentists increasingly encounter patients with edentulous sites and deficient bone who are seeking implant therapy. At some point in our career as implantologists, we go beyond the straightforward implant in the already-developed site, as well as the standard socket-preservation bone graft. Many of our patients have teeth extracted when a graft is cost-prohibitive or in settings where future implant placement is not a consideration. When this is the case, bone preservation or guided regeneration is not offered. They may then present with edentulous sites that are deficient not only potentially from the extraction process but also from shrinkage because of the time that has passed. This course demonstrates, via case presentation, some basic concepts in performing a single-site “onlay” graft to augment a deficient site. The generally accepted pillars of bone grafting are primary wound closure, angiogenesis, space maintenance and wound stability. I chose a scenario that I have found common in my specialty that will demonstrate all four pillars. This example of guided bone regeneration (GBR), when performed correctly with the right materials, can offer a high level of success for the future implant integration and stability of the subsequent restoration.",

    "description": "The topic of money in the dental practice is often a difficult one. As a business owner, you need money from patients to cover your overhead. Many patients see their financial responsibility as a hurdle and it’s a common reason they put off treatment. The majority of patient issues, and the main reasons patients leave dental practices, are often connected to money in some way.\nBecause a dental practice cannot survive without cash flow, it’s important to have the financial area of your practice well established with systems and a trained person making financial arrangements and collecting payments. Even if a doctor provides excellent dentistry, without a well-run financial department, the practice may end up with low treatment acceptance and patient acceptance, less-than-average collections, and a high number of upset patients and no-shows. It’s important to have the right person in the financial coordinator position—ideally, someone with interpersonal skills who can work with patients to create financial solutions so treatment is accepted and paid for.",

Perfect for every clinician, hygienist or team member who may be under the impression that the chronic environmental exposure to nitrous oxide could result in some type of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity in an expectant employee; this program debunks that myth.\n\nThis comprehensive review of animal studies, early non-clinical trials which led to the development of safer masks and scavenging systems and finally clinical trials which reinforce the wide margin of safety that this gas provides, this is a foundational course for all oral healthcare practitioners. As the late Dr. John Yageila is often quoted, “there has never been a death in a dental office, while dentistry is being done and nitrous oxide is the sole sedative being used.” We now know that this level of safety is not only imparted to our patients, many of whom may be pregnant, but definitely to our frontline workers who may be considering starting a family but are concerned about working in an office where nitrous oxide – oxygen inhalational sedation is provided.\n\nCase studies will augment the delivery of key points and a problem-based learning approach is encouraged so that each participant’s questions are addressed. After all, if the oath we all took upon graduation was to, “First, do no harm,” then why would you not want to offer your patients and staff the best and safest treatment possible?",

Dealing with this service for your patients can be stressful if you don’t have the right processes in place and the right person managing it all. It’s possible to practice without accepting insurance policies, but you will be limiting your growth because patients expect you to file their insurance and help them understand their benefits. Some dentists have decided to outsource the insurance system to a third party to handle rather than confront it internally. Your goal should be to establish the insurance system as a service for your patients and consider it an opportunity to set your practice apart from others. Having an insurance coordinator who is trained on all processes and is available to and known by your patients is invaluable. Patients choose their dental practice based on their experiences more than the dentistry.

Perfect for every clinician, hygienist or team member who may be concerned about their chronic environmental exposure to nitrous oxide, or even patients who are fearful of receiving this modality, this program reviews the nitrous oxide delivery system safety features currently in use.\n\nSurveys by the American Dental association and the Academy of General Dentistry demonstrate that the percentage of American dentists employing nitrous oxide – oxygen sedation is about 75 percent. The mechanics of nitrous oxide – oxygen delivery systems are differentiated commonly between two types of systems: either portable or fixed (plumbed in central system). Despite the large inherent margin of safety surrounding nitrous oxide – oxygen administration, at least 12 significant safety features have been developed to ensure the safe delivery of this gas regardless of the type of system employed. While manufacturers’ are initially responsible for making sure that these safety features are intact during production, the ultimate responsibility lies with the practitioner who chooses to utilize this delivery system in their practice. For this reason it is important for oral healthcare providers to be familiar with these safety features and how to maintain their integrity.\n\nThis program is comprehensive in its scope and will augment the delivery of key points with case examples to further enhance the learning experience.

    "description": "Time is every practice’s most valuable asset and one of the most important systems in the practice is scheduling. The success of every dental practice starts with the schedule. It can create stress, or it can create great success. Practice owners would like to avoid roller-coaster production numbers, broken appointments, poor patient retention, and growing unscheduled treatment lists, yet they often fail to appoint someone to remedy these issues. Dental teams tend to be robotic when it comes to their schedule, putting patients on it without a plan and even without financial arrangements. When the team starts the day and learns there are holes in the schedule, it leads to the doctor having nonproductive procedures. As patients cancel and those slots are not refilled, production goals are not met. There will always be chaos and unpredictability when everyone on the team is overscheduling and no one person has been appointed to be the scheduling coordinator. Most practices have never set up security levels in their software, so anyone on the team can undermine the efforts of the scheduler and call patients to come early—or even cancel them as they see fit. Even after appointing a scheduling coordinator, the practice may still struggle if that person still wears other hats and is unable to focus on actions that align with the position, putting the schedule on the back burner when it should be the most important front-office function. Nothing else matters if the schedule is not full and productive.",

    "description": "The future of dentistry is here and now. Teledentistry can become a revenue-generating addition to your practice while improving patient care. Since Covid, virtual visits are now part of reducing viral exposures in the dental office. Virtual visits can provide the pre-covid screening, triaging emergencies and palliating non-emergencies to save valuable chair time and PPEs. With all the PPE requirements to treat patients, virtual visits will be the most personal contact patients will have with their dental team. To reduce the adoption barrier, it is important to remember teledentistry is nothing new. As soon as two people could talk to each other on the telephone, and one complained about a toothache, that was tele-dentistry-using telecommunications in the care, treatment, and education of dentistry. Healthcare providers have been providing telephone consultations ever since. Now, adding a video component to that conversation allows the doctor to see the patient and visually assess the patient.\n\nIt is important to define what teledentistry is and is not. Understanding synchronous, asynchronous, mHealth and tele-dental education is key to integrating into your practice model. Prior to Covid, a survey by DentVox in 2019 showed that 78% of patients are likely to start using teledentistry in the next 5 years. During Covid, payors stepped up and started reimbursing teledentistry, several provided teledentistry for their members at no cost to the member. States expanded their teledentistry regulations, allowing dentists to provide teledentistry to their patients. Now teledentistry is a household word.\n\nSince Covid, virtual visits are now part of reducing viral exposures in the dental office. Virtual visits can provide the pre-covid screening, triaging emergencies and palliating non-emergencies to save valuable chair time and PPEs. With all the PPE requirements to treat patients, virtual visits will be the most personal contact patients will have with their dental team. The opportunity to “see” the dentist and staff free from masks, shields and protective gear will allow the interpersonal relationship to be established. Dentists who deliver services using teledentistry must establish protocols for appropriate referrals when necessary.\n\nEstimated that 180M people will not visit a dentist office. Virtual Technology empowers patients to take control of their dental health by overcoming their biggest issue. Going to the dentist!

    "description": "Many may think of a receptionist as being someone who sits at the front desk smiling and serving coffee to patients, but it’s just not the case anymore. Patient expectations are higher than ever. Just “good enough” will not help you build or grow your practice. Patients are tuned in to online reviews and social media posts, and have elevated awareness when it comes to customer service. They know there are many dental practices that would welcome them, and unless you have created loyal patients through better-than-average experiences, they will think nothing of leaving. Because most dental practices have system failures or no division of duties, the teams tend to go through the motions throughout the day and handle only the obvious and immediate tasks right before them. There’s little time to focus on exceeding patient expectations, promoting the practice and improving customer service. Practices may think they are organized, but key actions get left undone. This creates many missed opportunities and inconsistencies, which adds stress and increases the number of patient upsets. When patients call your practice or enter through the front door, they are comparing their experience to every other dental practice they’ve called or visited.

    "releaseDate": "9/30/2020",
    "description": "Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) can be difficult to treat and causes significant morbidity, but is largely preventable. Originally termed BONJ given the number of cases associated with bisphosphonate use, it is more commonly recognized as MRONJ today since the pathophysiology is due to two pharmacological classes of medications: antiresorptive (including bisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors) and antiangiogenic drugs. Newly published guidelines strongly recommend dental assessment and necessary remedial treatment before such drugs are commenced.\n\nMRONJ pathophysiology is still not completely elucidated. There are several suggested hypothesis that could explain its unique localization to the jaws: inflammation or infection, microtrauma, altered bone remodeling or over-suppression of bone resorption, angiogenesis inhibition, bisphosphonate toxicity, peculiar biofilm of the oral cavity, terminal vascularization of the mandible, suppression of immunity, or Vitamin D deficiency. Dental screening and adequate treatment are fundamental to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis in patients under antiresorptive or antiangiogenic therapy, or before initiating the administration.\n\nThe treatment of MRONJ is generally difficult and the optimal therapy strategy is still to be established. For this reason, prevention is even more important. It is suggested that a multidisciplinary team approach including a dentist, an oncologist, and a maxillofacial surgeon to evaluate and decide the best therapy for the patient. The choice between a conservative treatment and surgery is not easy, and it should be made on a case by case basis. However, the initial approach should be as conservative as possible. The most important goals of treatment for patients with established MRONJ are primarily the control of infection, bone necrosis progression, and pain. The aim of this program is to present the current knowledge about MRONJ, its preventive measures and management strategies.",
    "educationalObjectives": "Describe the risk factors for osteoporosis to include the normal bone remodeling process\nExplain the mechanisms of action of the bisphosphonates which may account for their association with ONJ\nDiscuss preventative measures in management of suspected ONJ patients\nIdentify commonly used medications associated with causing MRONJ\nDiscuss current treatment strategies to include an individualized, yet multimodal and evidence-based approach to success in managing these patients"

    "releaseDate": "9/16/2020",
    "description": "We have all dealt with a post restorative complaint and corrected it by adjusting a “high spot” that was inadvertently created during the procedure. Almost without fail a single adjustment resolves the complaint.\n\nWe have all dealt with patients who were hyper aware of their occlusion. Some of those patients get labeled as “occlusal neurotics.”\n\nThis CE course, then, is geared for the general dentist with the goals to improve daily occlusal adjustments in restorative therapy as well as to learn how to deal with more complex occlusal issues.\n\nThere is a continuum of disease that starts with a single tooth awareness that progresses to jaw discomfort and awareness that a bite is “uncomfortable” to a patient totally focused on their “bite” often seriously effecting the quality of their lives. The later stages of this disorder is termed “occlusal dysesthesia.”\n\nThere are many literature references to this somatic disorder. It is difficult to assess the frequency of the disorder. Because it is a continuum, many patients have a degree of the disorder and are therefore vulnerable to proceeding to a more serious, life altering form of the disease. The disorder is associated with a vicious cycle between an increased trigeminal signal and the reticular activating system. Appropriate treatment to interfere in this vicious cycle will be thoroughly explored.\n\nWhat steps do you take when a patients says things like----\n\n1. “My bite is uncomfortable.”\n2. “I don’t know where to bite – I keep trying to find the right place.”\n3. “I have two bites.”\n4. “I was fine and comfortable, but after my bite changed with that bridge I am in pain and have headaches.\n\n\n\nDo you ask your patient, “Do you grind your teeth at night?” After you adjust a restoration, do you have a a patient to tap their teeth and ask “How does that feel?\n\nThese questions can be problematic, and improved ways to assess the same information will be reviewed.\n\nOcclusal dysesthesia (OD) can be a serious disorder that in some cases has been associated with long term mental illness and suicide. OD is not a genetic disorder, and we as dentists can not only prevent this disorder from becoming a serious negative force in a patient’s life but can also be responsible for its progression.\n\nOnly dentists can recognize and treat this disorder, and the treatment does NOT involve occlusal adjustments. This course will help the restorative dentist place occlusion in the proper perspective and clarify goals of therapy in terms of occlusion.",

The good news isolation can be accomplished without a rubber dam even in very difficult areas such as second molars.\n\nUsing a simple tofflemire a tight Class II contact is readily possible. If the embrasure space is wide and/or there is deep root decay, a tight contact can be fabricated with a tofflemire set up. Equally tight contacts on both sides of a MOD’s predictable every time.

The dentist is well positioned to identify those at risk, and provide treatment or refer for treatment utilizing a team approach to care.\n\nMany factors impact a child’s airway including enlarged tonsils and adenoids, a high and narrow palate, mouth breathing, and a restricted tongue (often referred to as tongue-tie). Often overlooked, a tongue-tie is likely one of the initial factors that can predispose children and adults to the other airway issues later in life such as mouth breathing, a high palate, and enlarged tonsils. It also can cause sleep, feeding, and speech issues in children. Thankfully, a tongue-tie is the factor that is most easily treated by the dentist with proper technique, planning, and follow-up. In this course, we will help you to identify patients at risk for a restricted tongue and airway issues, and teach you evidence-based strategies to manage these patients and treat them effectively.\n\nWe don’t want any children to have a negative quality of life from something that can be released quickly and with minimal trauma to the child and family. Using the techniques in this course can be a starting point for those who wish to learn more about treating children with airway issues, and will help further inform those who have already started the journey of treating children and adults with tongue-ties.",
    "educationalObjectives": "Screen for, diagnose, and manage airway issues in their practice.\nKnow what impact a tongue-tie can have on a child's quality of life.\nKnow the proper techniques to assess a child for issues related to tongue and lip-ties.\nKnow the proper technique and positioning for completing a tongue-tie release.\nKnow whether they want to pursue additional training to treat tongue-tie and lip-tie in their office or refer for care."

The accessory innervation to the inferior alveolar nerve theory supports that the incidents of unsuccessful anesthesia may result from innervations of the adult mandible arising from the cervical plexus in addition to the auriculotemporal, buccal, mental, incisive, mylohyoid, and lingual nerves. Hence, to achieve profound pulpal anesthesia in the posterior mandible, an accessory innovation anesthetic protocol which anesthetizes all the accessory nerves has been clinically proposed.

    "description": "For patients in whom a tooth is congenitally missing or lost to caries or trauma and when an appropriate donor tooth is available to fill the space, autotransplantation can be a predictable procedure that has been employed worldwide for more than 50 years with great success. Autotransplantation relocates one’s own tooth from its original position to another site. This recipient tooth site could have a tooth treatment-planned for extraction or may be a recent extraction site, or could be an edentulous site, or the site of a congenitally missing tooth.\n\nThis article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of autotransplantation (AT); its treatment planning; a detailed sequence of the clinical procedure; and the criteria for the procedure’s success both pre- and postoperatively. With this information, clinicians should be able to add a successful treatment option for unrestorable or missing teeth, particularly in growing (pediatric and adolescent) patients who do not yet have the option for implant placement.",

    "description": "I have been restoring broken down dentitions with composite very successfully for over 30 years mainly due to the fact many of my patients simply could not afford conventional treatments with porcelain. I started out many years ago building up badly damaged single teeth and that worked well. It soon evolved out of desperation that I would do a whole arch usually lower teeth against an upper complete denture and that seemed to work well. The fact patients did so well with single arch rehabs I started doing both arches about 12-15 years ago and they have worked well. Many of my patients were older in their 60s and 70s and I have found they did well and were very appreciative that we could keep their teeth as many were advised by other dentists that their teeth were not restorable. Viewing this course will allow dentists to learn about an alternative treatment method to restore dentitions and save many teeth that traditionally would be lost since many patients can not afford porcelain.",
    "educationalObjectives": "Learn an alternative method of restoring broken down dentitions that would enable dentists to offer an additional treatment methodology\nLearn how to restore a single broken down tooth and hopefully can expand that to include a whole arch.\nLearn how to isolate the remaining stumps of these damaged teeth so you can maximize your bonding technique for long lasting restorations"

    "description": "The inferior alveolar nerve block has the highest failure rate not only in dental local anesthesia, but also among all local anesthetic blocks in medicine. The “accessory innervation to the inferior alveolar nerve” theory supports the idea that incidents of unsuccessful anesthesia may result from innervations of the adult mandible arising from the cervical plexus in addition to the auriculotemporal, buccal, mental, incisive, mylohyoid, and lingual nerves. Hence, to achieve profound pulpal anesthesia in the posterior mandible, an accessory innovation anesthetic protocol that anesthetizes all the accessory nerves has been clinically proposed. Three different accessory innervation anesthetic protocol approaches are described in this article, as well as how to overcome pulpal anesthesia failure by implementing the intraoral cervical plexus anesthetic technique. This protocol will help alleviate patient’s fear to the dental chair while improving our profession’s reputation.",

    "description": "\n\n\nTongue-tie is a very common condition affecting around 10% (or more) of the population. The controversial nature of tongue-tie is due to not having an accurate understanding of what it is, how to diagnose it, how it relates to common problems like nursing difficulties and speech issues, and how to treat it. There are also differing opinions about how to treat it by different disciplines from ENTs to pediatricians, dentists, speech therapists and lactation consultants. In this course, we will present the strong evidence supporting treatment of tongue-tie and lip-tie as it relates to breastfeeding, speech, and dental issues. The patient history, proper exam technique, making a diagnosis, and the research supporting treatment is discussed in detail in Part 1. It is critical to have a solid foundation of what a tongue and lip-tie are, how to recognize them, and the research that backs up the treatment before treatment should begin.\n\nIn this follow up course, Part 2, we will discuss treatment strategies, laser selection, a step-by-step technique, and a dozen clinical cases. There are many clinical videos to illustrate the technique with two different types of lasers (diode and CO2) that can be used to perform the procedure. The treatment is relatively simple, but the diagnosis, patient history, and case selection discussed in Part 1 is critical to ensure the treatment is necessary and can be effective. It is recommended to view Part 1 before viewing this course.",

Video demonstration of canal location techniques will help reinforce the material discussed.\n\nManagement of inflammation and infection in the endodontic emergency patient can be a challenge. Clinical techniques are discussed in detail to help the clinician manage hemorrhage and purulence as it presents in your patient. Video demonstrations through the microscope will help teach the techniques of intra-canal drainage and incision and drainage of tissue space swellings. Post-operative analgesic protocols and antibiotic administration will be discussed in detail along with examples of effective communication skills to offer your patients reassurance and proper instructions for the days following their emergency visit in your office.",

It’s time for you to get your game on.\n\nIt is not unusual to see dental offices write off 10%, 20%, 30% and more of their production due to PPO participation. After staff expenses, PPO write offs are among the biggest “expense” that a practice can have.\n\nPPOs are a reality of the current marketplace.

The right decisions here can add $1,000s to your bottom line and add greatly to your sense of control and security in the practice.\n\nWhatever your situation is, there is no question that you will have to make decisions about joining and leaving PPOs. Making the right moves as you participate with PPOs ensure a healthy bottom line and practice independence going into the future.\n\nThis hour of CE will give you and your staff the basics you need to level the playing field with the “big guys” at the PPOs.

    "description": "\n\n\nIn 2010, Wouldn’t it be great to be known as the dentist who offers excellent pain-free, post-operative care without the use of narcotics? Wouldn’t you like to be more confident in all of your prescription writing, knowing that you are on the cutting edge, that you are evidence-based and that you are guideline-driven? This is that program. In 2010, enough opioids were sold to medicate each American adult at a dose of 5mg of hydrocodone every four hours for one month. In 2011, the number of overdose deaths from painkillers more than tripled over a decade - a trend that a U.S. health official called an epidemic. By 2012 the National Center for Health Statistics reported that, “prescription painkillers have now surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of accidental death in the United States.” You do not want to be part of this problem. Remember the Spiderman Principle that, “with great power there must also come – great responsibility.” Since pain secondary to dentistry is due to inflammation, and narcotics are not anti-inflammatory agents, opioid-containing analgesic agents should not be part of your routine armamentarium in managing postoperative dental pain. To this end, statewide electronic databases known as Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs track all controlled substance prescriptions and in many cases now require consultation by dental prescribers if an opioid containing analgesic is to be initiated on a patient.\n\nBy taking this important continuing education program you become a better prescriber and you will learn the ideal analgesic recipe to manage (almost) all of your patients pain: first time, every time. More importantly, this evidence-based, guideline-driven program will give you actionable material to begin implementing immediately. Given the renewed focus on the war on licit drugs, you do not want to become the target of any investigation into misprescribing and you certainly do not want to add to the current problem of opioid access and abuse. Learn how to match the right drug at the right dose for the right patient now– because it is the right thing to do.",
    "educationalObjectives": "Discuss the pathophysiology of pain as it relates to dentistry.\nUnderstand the ideal analgesic recipe to manage (almost) all of your patients pain - first time, every time.\nExplain why narcotic-containing analgesics should not be routinely prescribed for post-operative dental pain\nDescribe the mechanism of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications\nDiscuss the importance of consulting one's state Prescription Drug Therapy Monitoring Program."

This course shows how the appliance can be used for both the maxilla and mandible as needed with the non distalizing arch used for anchorage. It can be used on adolescents or adults as well as non compliant patients. The mechanics for the MDA are quite simple and easy to perform. There are dozens of appliances for distalization but we prefer to use the MDA for several reasons. It is rare that both sides will require the same amount of distalization and this appliance allows unilateral and bilateral distalization, even different amounts per side during bilateral use. We will demonstrate the technique for doubling the anchorage on the distalized arch which reduces the amount of compliance required. We will also introduce interarch springs that can be ligated in placed in the event of total non compliance. With good compliance, you will see a translation of all the posterior teeth which significantly reduces the time spent with finishing mechanics and we will show how to mechanically retract the teeth during distalization if the teeth are not translating.\n\nWe will show the technique and demonstrate how to adapt the MDA for initial seating, initial activation, seating and ligation procedures and periodic adjustments. For clinical application, you will see a completed case presentation of the MDA for correction of a class II dental case from beginning to retention.",

    "description": "\n\n\nSuccessful management of the apical third of root canal systems has long been considered to be the most significant and challenging aspect of endodontic therapy. This is especially true in the treatment of apical periodontitis, where elimination of microorganisms is considered to be of the utmost importance for successful clinical outcomes. Significant, because the apical third contains the most important portals of exit of the root canal system to the periradicular area. Challenging, because it is the least accessible part of root canal systems with the most variation in anatomy, making cleaning and disinfection a daunting task. In addition, “successful management” needs to be achieved with minimal alteration to the original canal anatomy while maintaining tooth strength by preserving as much tooth structure as possible.\n\nThis lecture will review the importance and complexities of the apical third of root canal systems and will present a new, minimally invasive, laser treatment concept, Radial Apical Cleansing, for successful management of this critical area. The incorporation of Laser Activated Irrigation will play a significant role in the management of root canal system disinfection as well as clinical situations such as loss of patency due to calcification, blockages, ledging and complex canal anatomy. Special consideration will be given to Apical Foramen cleaning and the management of apical ramifications (deltas), lateral canals and isthmuses using laser energy.",

Basic concepts are reviewed to help end much of the confusion associated with the term “TMD.” This is THE occlusion course that makes the lives of dentists easier by giving useful common sense advice. Basic TMD concepts in terms of joint anatomy and physiology and are reviewed so that common patient reports of pain and dysfunction can be more readily diagnosed and conservatively treated.\n\nDentists have spent much time, money, and effort in order to gain a greater understanding of these basic concepts, and in the end, often the result is increased confusion and frustration. Our goal in this two hour presentation is to take the information taught and put it all in some realistic perspective. Often times procedures may be successful for reasons that are different than that which we assumed, leading us to some form of confirmation bias of a particular concept. These two hours will make that process clear, and help you to apply evidenced based science to the empirical nature of our knowledge base of occlusion.",

The ability to create a digital image with a capture device that can later be coupled with a milling unit allows the dentist the ultimate in versatility—the ability to provide “now” dentistry for routine one or two units. This provides a valuable service to patients while maintaining the flexibility of using a lab for more extensive restorative procedures.\n\nThis course will give the dentist a better perspective on how this technology can be a good fit for his or her office.",

    "description": "\n\n\nFor the clinician today there is a large range of all ceramic materials from which to choose. In some situations, only certain dental ceramics can be used with some materials being optimized for special purposes. It is important not only for the dental technician, but also for the dentist to know the specific properties, advantages and disadvantages of all ceramic restorative materials in order to achieve the best possible success rates, as ceramic materials are inherently prone to fracture due to their brittleness. In this lecture the various indications where dental ceramics can be used are explained and appropriate material options presented. Special attention is directed to the difference between the anterior region, which can be regarded as a low risk region, and the posterior region which demands special consideration, due to the higher occlusal forces, found on molars and premolars.",

    "description": "\n\n\nRoot canal retreatment is traditionally consider an “all or none” treatment approach. Meaning, all restorative and obturation material must be removed from the entire root canal space of all roots regardless of individual periapical health. In contrast, surgical endodontics is not viewed as an “all or none” approach. It is a generally accepted that only the diseased root(s) should be addressed via root end resection and root end filling. Knowledge gained from CBCT imaging has introduced a new reasonable treatment option for endodonticaly treated teeth presenting with post treatment disease. This new concept allows the clinician to make predictable treatment decisions based on the periapical status of an individual root(s) rather than make assumptions about the tooth as a whole. A “selective root retreatment” combines the approach of an orthograde retreatment with the selectivity of a retrograde surgical root resection. It is being suggested that retreatment could be limited to a single root or roots clearly demonstrating periapical pathology while leaving the root(s) with no visible or perceived pathology untouched.",

The standard techniques used are very sensitive, and are bound to a certain experience from a large number of surgeries. They also have a high learning curve.\n\nDespite these facts, augmentation procedures are often the least planned part of the therapy and based on poor diagnostics. Due to a lack of standardized protocols these procedures are often performed by the surgeons favorite method instead of the most indicated one.\n\nIt is astonishing, that for implant placement advanced techniques are used - cone beam, navigation templates etc. - whereas augmentation procedures are often based on a high percentage of improvisation.\n\n3D diagnostics, the use of standardized protocols ( plug and play ) and prefabricated allograft materials do allow a reduction of treatment time and trauma for the patient by raising the reliability and success rate of this procedure. This will make these procedures open to a larger number of implantologists and improve overall quality of implant treatments.",

    "description": "\n\n\nIn a general dentistry practice it is very common to see patients who have orthodontic relapse and want some esthetic correction, or patients who have never had orthodontic treatment but are interested in doing orthodontics now that they are adults. Typically many dentists would simply refer patients to an orthodontist or suggest veneers or crowns. However many patients are not receptive to shaving down perfectly good teeth to address their esthetic concerns nor prepared to undergo extensive orthodontic treatment. For some orthodontics is strictly cosmetic, however we know that crowded teeth can make it hard for patients to perform adequate homecare which can lead to tooth decay and periodontal problems. These patients are also candidates for short term or aligner type of orthodontics.\n\nMany patients are also not concerned about their bite or back teeth, only that their front teeth are crowded and unsightly. Imagine if you could provide limited orthodontic treatment to your patients and complete necessary periodontal and root canal therapy as well as finish the case with in-office fabrication of crowns. Using available technologies can allow the general dentist to comfortably and confidently treat these patients making it a very rewarding experience for the patient and dentist. Transforming a smile is both rewarding and satisfying not only to the patient but also to the dentist. This course will illustrate how to treat a patient with several orthodontic treatment modalities that have protocols that eliminate much of the uncertainty of treatment and can actually make limited orthodontic treatment fun and rewarding.",

    "description": "\n\n\nThe internal anatomy of human teeth consists of a highly complicated network of multi-planar curved, anastomotic canals, as seen in studies of root canal anatomy. Navigating efficiently, safely and predictably has been a matter of extensive effort and research over the years. The ultimate objective had always been the safe and predictable three dimensional chemo-mechanical debridement and obturation of the root canal system. However thorough instrumentation and enlargement of the apical region to achieve root canal disinfection has long been considered to be a crucial factor in the cleaning and shaping process. Greater apical preparations have the potential to more efficiently remove the debris and allow proper irrigation to the apical part of the canals. On the other hand, instrumentation with conventional rotary or reciprocating NiTi files to larger apical diameters, has the potential to generate cracks on the apical surface and induce dentinal damage and transportation in curved canals. Recently, a novel NiTi alloy with flexible properties called CM wire (Controlled memory wire) was introduced in the market. CM rotary files are extremely flexible and fatigue resistant, but without the shape memory of conventional NiTi files. The lack of shape memory effect and the superior flexibility of controlled memory files provide them the ability to follow the anatomy, reducing the risk of dentinal damage, even when larger apical preparations are required.\n\nThis course is designed to thoroughly discuss the potential of delivering larger apical preparations in extremely curved or double curved canal systems efficiently, safely and predictably by taking advantage of the controlled memory alloy properties. Never fear curved canals and file breakage again!",

There are huge expectations for ourselves and from our patients, including whether all the restorations will seat correctly, will they all match, or will there be any contamination or bleeding and this all adds to the stress. The last thing we need is for the actual cementation process, try-in and veneer and tooth preparation protocol to add to this stress. Dr. David Hornbrook has mentored thousands of clinicians throughout the world on correct utilization of veneer adhesive systems and has created an efficient and predictable technique for bonding in anterior restorations entitled the “Tack & Wave” technique. This protocol is currently being taught at most of the major teaching centers and most post-graduate university programs. Join Dr. Hornbrook as he discusses Veneer try-in and selection of cements, adjustment of the ceramic during try-in, state-of-the-art adhesive systems, selection of cements, and proper finishing and polishing techniques.

    "description": "\n\n\nDense PTFE is non-resorbable and chemically stable. In addition to its long history in the field of guided tissue regeneration, PTFE has been used for over 30 years in cardiovascular applications such as suture, vascular grafts and heart valves. PTFE is bio-inert and does not cause inflammation. If manufactured with a small pore size (0.3 microns), bacteria are prevented from entering the structure of the barrier while still allowing diffusion of oxygen and small molecules across the membrane. Upon implantation, dense PTFE is immediately coated with plasma proteins, facilitating cellular adhesion to the smooth, biocompatible surface. This cellular adhesion is observed to form a hermetic seal, providing resistance to migration of bacteria and epithelial cells around and under the membrane when it is exposed in the mouth. Plasma protein adsorption also facilitates diffusion of soluble organic molecules across the membrane. Removal of dense PTFE is simplified due to the lack of tissue ingrowth into the surface structure. The primary advantage of high-density PTFE is the ability to remain exposed in the mouth while protecting the underlying defect and bone graft. The membrane is soft, flexible and easy to handle. Primary closure is not required and the membrane may be removed without additional surgery if exposed. If primary closure technique is used, the membrane may be easily removed through a small incision in a flapless technique.",

    "description": "Implants are no longer the occasional means of replacing missing teeth. Whether they are used in conjunction with removable or fixed prosthetics, they are now the number one tool that dentists have to restore a dentition with one or multiple missing teeth. But how does one assess whether an implant has successfully integrated and is ready to restore? And more importantly how does one assess whether an implant with a restoration is doing its job and is clinically viable? In this comprehensive course, Dr. Carl Misch goes into detail on how to evaluate the success of an implant in your patient’s mouth. He describes what to look for clinically when doing patient exams to make this assessment with certainty. Both hygienists and dentists can go through a list of criteria and evaluate the results and know what steps to take depending on the results. Many examples of successes and failures are shown in this presentation from Dr. Misch’s case files to help one understand this important evaluation process. In addition, Dr. Misch describes how to avoid the most common reasons that implants fail.\n\nThis course is a must see for clinicians in dental practices that not only place or restore implants, but also for those dental practices that have patients that already have had implants placed.

    "description": "Wear is a common problem we see in our practices. Deciding how to help our patients preserve their tooth structure and dental health depends on the cause of the wear. At the top of the list are attrition, caused by rubbing the teeth together and erosion where the teeth dissolve due to the presence of acid. Additionally we can see tooth wear from abrasion, caused by abrasive toothpastes and other oral hygiene products and abfraction, which is a loss of cervical tooth structure due to occlusal forces.\n\nThis program will describe the different clinical presentations that differentiate between the types of tooth wear. Determining which tooth surfaces are losing mass and showing signs of wear is a key first step to knowing the cause. Erosive patterns can occur on any tooth surfaces whether the patient can occlude there or not. Often these patterns are unique to the cause of the acid helping differentiate between GERD, Bulimia or Citrus Mulling. Attrition displays wear facets that are flat in character with the enamel and dentin being level, unlike erosion where the dentin disappears in depressions.",

    "description": "Seventy percent of the population is missing one or more teeth. The traditional method to replace a tooth is a fixed partial denture. As a consequence of this device, the adjacent teeth decay almost 25% of the time. The pontic acts as a plaque trap and often causes decay at the crown margin next to the pontic. In addition, the abutment teeth of a fixed partial denture require endodontics for the decay or trauma of preparing the tooth almost 15% of the time. The endodontic treated tooth fails 10% of the time. In addition, the tooth may fracture as a result of the endodontic treatment. As a result of the decay or endodontics complications the abutment tooth is lost almost 30% of the time within 10 to 15 years. A dental implant to replace a missing tooth does not have to crown additional teeth and splint them together. The implant does not decay or need endodontic therapy. As a result, the implant and adjacent teeth last longer and are more predictable than traditional fixed prostheses.\n\nThis program explains to the dental team the consequences of preparing and having crowns on adjacent teeth splinted together to replace missing teeth. The advantages of implants to replace the teeth are presented in a format for doctors, staff and patients to understand the benefits of implant dentistry.",

    "description": "Being a pioneer in live-patient treatment courses, Dr. Hornbrook has mentored thousands of dentists chairside as they have prepared and placed porcelain veneers on their patients. The fundamentals of correct veneer preparation is something that is rarely addressed in dental school and even often skipped over in many of the cosmetic courses on smile designs and full mouth rehabilitations. A thorough understanding of how to correctly prepare the teeth for veneers is as equally as important as understanding ceramic materials and correct adhesive principles and improper preparation can certainly compromise the aesthetics and functional final results. Dr. Hornbrook has often stated in lectures that too many dentists “Prep and Pray” for a predictable result and do not take the time to design the smile and utilize this design to prepare teeth correctly. In this presentation, he discusses the use of a wax-up done by the laboratory and the use of preparation matrices to ensure predictable and repeatable results. He also discusses detailed preparation designs including correct margin placement, how to alter preparation with diastemas, and how to address existing Class III composites and interproximal caries.

Yet, less than 3% of a dentists’ time is spent treating this section of the population.\n\nThere are 30 million people in the USDA that are missing some of their teeth in at least one dental study and 20 million people have no teeth at all. Once the teeth are lost, not only are function, speech and health reduced, there is loss of bone. The bone loss after tooth loss may be more than 20 mm in height of bone in each haw. As a consequence, facial esthetics is severely compromised.\n\nDental implants stimulate bone and prevent the gross bone loss after tooth loss.

Many times the dentist misplaces the blame of the need for excessive adjustment when inserting new crown and bridge restorations. Both dentist and dental technician must be fully schooled in the various possibilities relative to occlusal planning and occlusal conditions that can lead to much greater value of these restorations for our patients.\n\nCourse 2: Techniques and Material Selection for Optimum Esthetics\nThe challenge of keeping up with the rapidly evolving array of options in esthetic restorative dentistry can be daunting and it is critical that both the dentist and the dental laboratory technician maintain an understanding of the indications and limitations of the various indirect restorative materials available, and the strengths and weaknesses of each. Subjects presented include, determining when the metal-ceramic restoration is still considered the restoration of choice, what situations are best satisfied by bonded porcelain restorations, which all-ceramic restorative systems can dependably mask discolorations and metallic build-ups, and how some systems match particular shade and translucency situations better than others.\n\nCourse 3: Improved Predictability With Advanced Esthetics\nClinical success can be defined by achieving a result that is aesthetic, functional and predictable. Today's demand for such a high level of aesthetics and predictability require a collaborative effort between the dentist and technician. This seminar investigates the factors that allow a relationship between the dentist and technician to result in extraordinary and predictable results.

    "description": "The challenge of keeping up with the rapidly evolving array of options in esthetic restorative dentistry can be daunting. It is critical that both the dentist and the dental laboratory technician maintain an understanding of the indications and limitations of the various systems.\n\nIn this presentation, discussed are the indirect restorative materials available, and the strengths and weaknesses of each. Additionally, covered are critical communications that must take place between the dentist and ceramist, and how to determine what materials best satisfy different restorative situations. Subjects presented include, determining when the metal-ceramic restoration is still considered the restoration of choice, what situations are best satisfied by bonded porcelain restorations, which all-ceramic restorative systems can dependably mask discolorations and metallic build-ups, and how some systems match particular shade and translucency situations better than others.",
    "educationalObjectives": "1. Gain an understanding of the various all-ceramic systems, their relative strengths, methods of fabrication and how they should be bonded or cemented.\n2. Learn to recognize which restorative systems might best satisfy a given set of esthetic and functional demands.\n3. Learn the critical aspects of preparation design that are unique to all-ceramic, milled restorations and gain confidence in communicating these."

    "description": "Clinical success can be defined by achieving a result that is aesthetic, functional and predictable. Today's demand for such a high level of aesthetics and predictability require a collaborative effort between the dentist and technician. This seminar investigates the factors that allow a relationship between the dentist and technician to result in extraordinary and predictable results.\n\nHistorically, restorations have been fabricated to work within an \"envelope of function\". Remember, when we chew, teeth actually don’t touch. Given that fact, it isn’t during the envelope of function that teeth or restorations fail. Instead, it is when we extend beyond and into the \"Envelope of Parafunction\" that destruction occurs. If we can create restorations that exist within this envelope of parafunction, we have better opportunity for success. This presentation introduces the \"Outside/Inside\" evaluation. This refers to seven specific steps that must be considered when developing any treatment plan. Following these steps result in restorations that are aesthetic and functional while improving predictability. Other factors that contribute to consistency and predictable restorations will be discussed.",
    "educationalObjectives": "1. Seven essential steps of treatment planning for aesthetics and predictability\n2. Implications of occlusion disease and its relation to success\n3. Understanding incisal edge position and tooth length\n4. Importance of Anterior Guidance and angle of disclusion\n5. \"Simple\" Restorative Sequence\n6. Communication to the technician of the desired occlusal outcome and ensuring restoration fabrication within parafunctional parameters\n7.

    "description": "Typical whitening systems are designed to provide what dentists and patients want, however these “wants” typically fly in the face of what is physically and chemically possible. For whitening success, tooth color molecules must be broken down by radicals produced by peroxide, however, there are a myriad of stumbling blocks to achieving this goal. With most current whitening systems, peroxide gels may already be degraded when received because of inadequate handling and lack of refrigeration by whitening product companies; gels may be chemically altered to lengthen shelf life, leading to acidic pH, higher osmolarity, higher sensitivity and less effectiveness of the products; and they typically have inadequate continuous activity to accomplish thorough cleansing and whitening of tooth structure. In-office whitening lacks the time necessary to thoroughly degrade color molecules, and antioxidants found in saliva and sulcular fluid rapidly seep under and into whitening trays, destroying peroxide on contact.",

This gap can lead to frustration, compromise patient care, and cost tens of thousands of dollars or even hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in lost practice income.\n\nCountless articles have been written about Case Acceptance: How to set up and plan consults, sales techniques to use and even scripted dialogue. Without the right foundation, these techniques can actually harm the Doctor/Patient relationship and the practice. None of these things work as well as creating a strong ethical foundation. This seemingly philosophical approach has very real and practical benefits that will add significantly to your bottom line and peace of mind.",

    "description": "This course is about how one uses color to get that perfect shade match. Color is an integral part of aesthetic dentistry. If the color of a restoration is off, the mistake can be glaringly evident and the result is an unhappy patient. Most dental schools do not do an adequate job in teaching color theory. Color theory is a language that conceptually and perceptually describes the elements of color and their interactions. Unfortunately, understanding color is tricky. Slight variances in shade play with our eyes, our minds, and, ultimately, our dentistry. The illumination in the dental treatment room, optical illusions, color blindness, and fatigue are among the dental professional’s ongoing obstacles to successful shade matching.\n\nThis course will enlighten the dentist and ceramist on the dimensions of color, the effect of metamerism and other phenomenon using actual examples from Dr. Ochi's own cases. By being fluent in the language of color, we can sharpen our perception of color, better understand existing color dynamics, make better predictions, and communicate more clearly about color. A review of these concepts as rules and guidelines will be presented in a manner that can be utilized to resolve complex aesthetic problems.",
    "educationalObjectives": "1. Understand the interactions of light, color, color perception and shade matching.\n2. Understand the difference between additive and subtractive color theory.\n3.

    "description": "The computerization of our society has definitely penetrated the dental industry and has an impact on material selection and efficiency. A popular dental material, zirconia, may only be made digitally. Although dentists continue to send physical impressions to their dental labs for these restorations, they must be digitized to allow for the CAD/CAM application of zirconia. With this process, a digital model is required.\n\nIf the doctor initiates the process with a digital optical scan, rather than a physical impression, the information can be analyzed by the doctor for preparation quality. This is done during the scanning process and prior to uploading the information through the Internet to their lab. Subsequently, the lab can use the digital model for restoration fabrication in a timely fashion. With modern tooth modeling algorithms and tools, the design process for the prosthesis is quickly rendered. Therefore, the restoration can be made efficiently and the patient can be delighted with the high-tech feel for the process.",
    "educationalObjectives": "1. Understand the basic digital optical scanning pros and cons.\n2. Use digital scanning as a tool to analyze the quality of preparations.\n3.

    "description": "A prophylaxis is reserved for healthy patients with no signs of periodontal disease. The need for more than 20 minutes of subgingival instrumentation during a prophylaxis appointment shifts the focus from health to periodontal disease. Periodontal disease might be overlooked during a prophylaxis because of four reasons: improper probing technique, insurance roadblocks, unclear practice philosophy and financial profiling. To avoid providing periodontal therapy during a prophylaxis, a three-step plan of action should be followed. This plan includes periodontal assessments, discussing the findings with the patient and taking the time to explain to the patient the treatment that is needed. Understanding the reasons periodontal disease might be overlooked and following a plan of action when periodontal disease is present will assure that prophy appointments do not include unplanned periodontal instrumentation.",

Rather than a discussion of how each of these should be disinfected and sterilized, this lecture focuses on determining what to do by how to the items are used in patient care. In addition to discussion of categorization of patient care items and sterilization techniques, practitioners are guided through a discussion of types of germicidal products. These should be evaluated carefully.\n\nIn general, choosing the right germicidal product is important. What you choose in a germicidal agent depends on a number of factors, such as the nature of the contamination (meaning the organic material such as whether it is blood or saliva), the amount of the contamination present, the type of germicide used and whether it is sporicidal or tuberculocidal. The spray, wipe, spray approach is easy to remember for environmental surfaces. Sterilization and disinfection also extends to other areas, such as the laboratory, the dental unit water lines, evacuation systems and amalgam separator issues. Use and careful removal of wraps or covers used in the operatory is also highlighted.",

The typical dentist’s training in oral surgery is usually quite rudimentary, but in private practice, referral to a specialist may not be an option in every case. Yet, should a problem arise, general practitioners are held to the same standard of care as the specialist.\n\nThis series aims to increase the knowledge level and comfort zone of the general dentist when performing surgical procedures. Topics to be covered on this second module include presurgical planning, local anesthesia, design and use of surgical flaps, handpieces and hand instruments, and management of the surgical site. Subsequent chapters will cover impacted third molars, biopsy indications and techniques, and management of complications.",
    "educationalObjectives": "Understand the issues to decide whether they should be performing surgical extractions and impaction surgery.\nBe better able to treatment plan surgical extraction cases to reduce wasted surgical time and frustration.\nKnow which local anesthetic techniques are needed for surgical extractions.\nUnderstand design of surgical flaps to improve access and visualization of the surgical site.\nAppreciate the difference between a surgical handpiece and a standard dental handpiece, and understand when each should be used.\nKnow how to manage the extraction site for multiple extractions and implant site preparation."
